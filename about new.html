            The human body contains five liters of blood, which is made of several useful components i.e. Whole blood, Platelet, and Plasma.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each type of component has several medical uses and can be used for different medical treatments. your blood donation determines the best donation for you to make.
            <br>
            <br>
            For plasma and platelet donation you must have donated whole blood in past two years.

        <p style="margin: 10px;">
            Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:

            <br>
            <p style="margin: 10px;">In some countries national legislation permits 16-17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin: 10px;">In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin: 15px;">Health:  </h4>

            <p style="margin: 10px;">Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral .</p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin: 10px;">Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.</p>
            
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin: 15px;">Pregnancy and breastfeeding:</h4>
            <p style="margin: 10px;">Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin: 10px;">It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).</p>
