                        The human body contains five liters of blood, which is made of several useful components i.e. Whole blood, Platelet, and Plasma.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Each type of component has several medical uses and can be used for different medical treatments. your blood donation determines the best donation for you to make.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For plasma and platelet donation you must have donated whole blood in past two years.

                    <h2 style="color: #ff2156;"> Who all can't Donate?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4> Age: </h4>
                        <br>
                        You are aged between 18 and 65.
                        <br>
                        In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.
                        <br>
                        In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Weight:</h4>
                        <br>
                        You weigh at least 50 kg.    
                        <br>
                        In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% .
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Health:  </h4>    
                        <br>
                        You must be in good health at the time you donate.
                        <br>
                        You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.
                        <br>
                        If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.
                        <br>
                        If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.
                        <br>
                        You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation
                        <br>
                        A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Travel:</h4> 
                        <br>
                        Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral .
                        <bR>
                        Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>You must not give blood:</h4>
                        <br>
                        If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months
                        <br>
                        Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently: 
                        <br>
                        Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)
                        <br>
                        Have ever injected recreational drugs.
                        <br>
                        In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Pregnancy and breastfeeding:</h4>
                        <br>
                        Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.
                        <br>
                        It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).
